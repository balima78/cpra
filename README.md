Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody with R

This is an R package with functions to compute calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) values from given allelic and haplotypic HLA frequencies.

In here, we have three main functions.: cpras() which computes cPRAs values for a group a patients with their HLA sensitization; txComps() which computes a transplantability score assuming AB0 compatibility for patients' HLA sensitization; and txIdents() which computes a transplantability score assuming AB0 identical for patients' HLA sensitization.
